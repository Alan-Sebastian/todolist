ABSTRACT
We present a student to-do list web app for students to efficiently manage their daily
routines and tasks. The manual process of scheduling and tracking to do list is inefficient
and it is difficult to keep consistency. This project aims to give a user friendly and more
efficient way for students to manage their academic activities. It also provides means to
analyse day to day tasks efficiency by displaying progress of each task in graphs. When the
tasks are completed,they are marked as completed.
